# Image-Recovery

Overview: applying compressed sensing to recover the corrupted image. Lasso regression is used to calculate the best coefficient for each small block of a picture. Then applying DCT inverse transform to achieve the recover image. The whole project mainly conducted by Python. Turns out compressed sensing has a good capability on recover corrupted image which the good pixels are identified already.
